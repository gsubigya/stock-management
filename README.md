# STOCK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project implements a simple inventory management and sales system designed for Stock Management.

## System Overview

The system is built using Python and consists of the following modules:

* **main.py:** The primary entry point of the program. Provides users with a main menu interface offering product viewing and exit options.

* **display.py:**  Handles the following:
    * Displays available products by reading from the "data.txt" file.
    * Processes customer purchase selections according to their chosen product.
    * Updates the "data.txt" inventory file to reflect changes in stock.
    * Generates invoices and saves them in the "INVOICES" folder.

* **inventory.py:**  Responsible for creating invoices in a structured, easy-to-read format.

* **update.py:** Contains functions for:
    * Displaying a welcome greeting to the Pashupati Electronics system.
    * Updating the "data.txt" file with the current inventory information.

## Dependencies

* **OpenCV** (This dependency is needed only if your "display.py" utilizes OpenCV for any image or video processing features)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install any required dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python  # (Install only if needed by "display.py")

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Follow the menu prompts to interact with the system:
    * Choose to view the product list.
    * Exit the program.

## File Structure
* data.txt: Stores inventory data with each line representing a product. Data is stored in a comma-separated format (product name, price, quantity).
* INVOICES: This folder contains customer invoices generated by the system. Each invoice is stored as a .txt file.
